## About <a name="about"></a>

This Dojo Project is designed to showcase the implementation of various Machine Learning (ML) techniques in analyzing features of anime. It serves as both a portfolio piece and a technical blog, demonstrating practical applications of ML in the entertainment industry.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

In this project, we explore different aspects of anime using data analysis and machine learning. Our goal is to provide insights into anime characteristics, viewer preferences, and trends within the industry. This project serves as an example of how ML can be applied to media content analysis.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Genre classification
- Popularity prediction
- Content recommendation system
- Visual style analysis
- Character archetype identification

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Download the anime dataset
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anime-feature-analysis.git
   

2. Install required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Download the anime dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) and place it in the `data` folder.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   
   jupyter notebook
   

5. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This project contains several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific aspect of anime analysis:

1. `data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial data analysis and visualization
2. `genre_classification.ipynb`: ML model for classifying anime genres
3. `popularity_prediction.ipynb`: Predicting anime popularity based on features
4. `recommendation_system.ipynb`: Building a content-based recommendation system
5. `visual_style_analysis.ipynb`: Analyzing visual styles using computer vision techniques
6. `character_archetype.ipynb`: Identifying common character archetypes

To use these notebooks, open them in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially. Each notebook includes detailed explanations and comments to guide you through the analysis process.

## Machine Learning Techniques <a name="ml-techniques"></a>

This project demonstrates the following ML techniques:

- Supervised Learning: Classification and Regression
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Natural Language Processing: Text Analysis and Sentiment Analysis
- Computer Vision: Image Classification and Feature Extraction
- Recommendation Systems: Content-Based Filtering

Each technique is explained in detail within the respective notebooks, showcasing practical applications in the context of anime analysis.
